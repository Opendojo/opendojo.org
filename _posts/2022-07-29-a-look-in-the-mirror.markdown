## A Small Retrospective

Almost 7 years ago I setup this space and I was convinced it would be an awesome place to share experience and best dojo practice.

It wasn't.

## Why?

I didn't put any energy in it! I spoke about it. I met people. We discussed a lot. And I was working way hard to move on. Learning Machine learning. Learning Crypto. Learning Programs management... and in the end spending a lot less time with the team.
A lot of new people came in. It was time to move out, leave room.

There where plenty of new idea, new concept.

## And what now?

I look in the mirror and see amazing things. But I cannot keep that for me alone. So let's say the concept remains the same... and I finally choose to get some time to do it.

So I want to speak about the early days in 2004 when I was pair programming and playing cards to determine the business values. I didn't know it was some kata I was practicing already.

Also working with new kids in the team and onboarding them was an opportunity to write test first and program after. In a more pilot / Co-pilot way.

I had the chance during the first agile tour Lille in 2008 to meet 2 guys that had a TDD Dojo Kata workshop in Java. I had never written anything in java (or I forgot) but this day during 2 hours I have been writing java code to pass the necessary step.
It was awesome.
I learned TDD and at the same time what was a Dojo and what were the Katas.

I have been practicing martial arts (Karate mainly) for years so the idea and the concept was well know to me. I never though it could be done for Computer Science. But after this I though to myself: "We can do anything in the Dojo / Kata / Martial Art way".

Also late I had the chance to do a ruby on rails opendojo with amazing people (the ruby community) and jesus I learned a lot!

Now it's time to share. Everybody should be able to create a dojo and sharing is caring :-)

## What's next

* I'll post 6 times a year Dojo concept card with all the necessary steps to be done by any team.
* I'll push forward Open Dojo github community
* I'll find some people to create an awesome look and feel
* I'll enhance the SEO
